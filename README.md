This repository is created temporarily while the project is ongoing. 
Once/If it's completed, another repository with a more appropriate name will be created. ðŸ˜‚

## What is this?
An in-progress/incomplete and flawed game library ðŸ˜‚  

## Current Progress
`Note: I know it doesn't look very nice ðŸ˜‚`  

![Demonstration](https://github.com/A-amon/Typescript-Practice/blob/main/assets/demo.gif)

## What does it help you to do?
- Positioning the tiled map at any of these positions: `top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right, center-left, center-right, top-center, bottom-center, center`
- Placing different tile images using any of the provided 3 patterns (Details can be found [here](https://github.com/A-amon/Typescript-Practice/blob/main/scripts/ts/Interfaces.ts) ðŸ˜›)
- Adding collidable game objects and trigger callback function (Only one collidable can be added for any particular tile)
- Adding state and re-render whenever you wish with `updateAfter()` (Worst way of doing it but will improve on it soon ðŸ˜Œ)
- Navigate to different route/scene

Examples of their usage can be found in [index.ts](https://github.com/A-amon/Typescript-Practice/blob/main/scripts/ts/index.ts) and [Page2.html](https://github.com/A-amon/Typescript-Practice/blob/main/pages/Page2.html)
