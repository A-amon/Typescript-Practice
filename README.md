## What is this?
An in-progress/incomplete and flawed game library ðŸ˜‚  

## Current Progress
`Note: I know it doesn't look very nice ðŸ˜‚`  

![Demonstration](https://github.com/A-amon/Typescript-Practice/blob/main/assets/demo.gif)

## What does it help you to do?
- Positioning the tiled map at any of these positions: `["left" | "right" | "center", "top" | "bottom" | "center"]`
- Placing different tile images using any of the provided 3 patterns (Details can be found [here](https://github.com/A-amon/Typescript-Practice/blob/main/scripts/ts/Interfaces.ts) ðŸ˜›)
- Adding collidable game objects and trigger callback function (Only one collidable can be added for any particular tile)
- Adding state and re-render whenever you wish with `updateAfter()` (Done by referencing React's virtual DOM structure - most likely inefficient compared to the real thing ðŸ˜Œ)
- Navigate to different route/scene

Examples of their usage can be found in [index.ts](https://github.com/A-amon/Typescript-Practice/blob/main/scripts/ts/index.ts) and [Page2.html](https://github.com/A-amon/Typescript-Practice/blob/main/pages/Page2.html)
